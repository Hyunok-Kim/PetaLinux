PetaLinux Firmware Application Template
===================================

This directory contains a PetaLinux firmware application created from a template.

Adding a xsa to srcuri,  the dfx_user_dts class will assume no
other dependencies and automatically pack the ${PN}.dtbo ${PN}.bit.bin into rootfs.

1.Before building the application, you will need to enable the application
from PetaLinux menuconfig by running below command if you do not specify --enable option
while creating the application.
    "petalinux-config -c rootfs"
You will see your application in the "User Packages --->" submenu
to pack this firmware artifacts as part of rootfs.

2.You will need to rebuild PetaLinux bootable images so that the images
is updated with the updated target filesystem copy, run this command:
    "petalinux-build -c rootfs"
              or
You can also run one PetaLinux command to install the application to the
target filesystem host copy and update the bootable images as follows:
    "petailinux-build"

To generate only rpm with firmware artifacts and not packing in rootfs
no need to give --enable option while creating, run this command:
    "petalinux-build -c @appname@"
you can find the rpm in build/tmp/deploy/rpm directory.

Note: The shell.json will not applicable for zynq platforms
as the file will be used while loading with dfx_mgr and dfx_mgr
support not added for zynq.

For versal and zynqmp based on the design type shell.json content
"shell_type" and num_slots might vary please refer below dfx_mgr doc
for more details.
